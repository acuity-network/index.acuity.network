This repository includes an in-repo Polkadot SDK runtime under `runtime/` and a
matching synthetic index-spec renderer in `src/synthetic_devnet.rs`.

The synthetic stack exists to test and benchmark the real indexer against a
deterministic local chain without depending on external networks.

## Stack Layers

1. `runtime/` builds a small runtime WASM
2. `polkadot-omni-node` runs that runtime locally
3. `src/synthetic_devnet.rs` renders the matching index spec
4. `seed_synthetic_runtime` writes deterministic on-chain data
5. Acuity Index indexes the chain normally and is validated through its public API

The synthetic runtime now includes GRANDPA so finalized indexing and proof
responses can be exercised locally.

## Useful Commands

Start a local dev node:

```bash
just synthetic-node
```

Seed a small smoke dataset:

```bash
just seed-smoke
```

Run the external node-backed integration suite:

```bash
just test-integration
```

The ignored integration suite now covers both ordinary `GetEvents` queries and
proof-oriented requests using `includeProofs`.

- In default mode it verifies that proofs are reported as unavailable.
- In finalized mode it starts a libp2p-enabled local node, runs the indexer with
  `--finalized`, requests proofs, and verifies the returned header and storage
  proof against the block state root.

## Why This Matters

The synthetic setup does not bypass the normal indexing path. It exercises:

- RPC access
- runtime metadata decoding
- index key derivation
- `sled` persistence
- WebSocket request and notification behavior
- finalized event proof responses

That makes it the main contributor workflow for validating cross-module changes.
