## Running The Service

The main command is:

```bash
acuity-index run <INDEX_SPEC> [OPTIONS]
```

Common runtime flags:

- `--options-config <PATH>`
- `--db-path <PATH>`
- `--db-mode <MODE>`
- `--db-cache-capacity <SIZE>`
- `--url <URL>`
- `--queue-depth <N>`
- `--finalized`
- `--port <PORT>`
- `--metrics-port <PORT>`

## Startup Behavior

At startup the process:

1. loads and validates the index spec
2. resolves runtime options
3. opens `sled`
4. verifies or initializes the stored `genesis_hash`
5. starts the public WebSocket server and optional metrics listener
6. enters a reconnecting RPC/indexer supervisor loop

Important invariant:

- one database directory belongs to one chain genesis hash

If the stored hash and configured or connected chain do not match, startup fails
instead of mixing data.

## Reconnect And Resume

The indexer persists span state so it can resume after restart. On transient RPC
failure it keeps the process alive, saves the active span, reconnects with
exponential backoff, and resumes without requiring a clean full restart.

During that window:

- sled-backed reads can continue to work
- existing clients stay connected
- RPC-backed requests such as `Variants` return temporary unavailability

## Hot Reload

When the active `<INDEX_SPEC>` file changes, accepted edits restart only the
RPC/indexer loop. The WebSocket and metrics servers remain up.

Changes to `name` or `genesis_hash` are rejected.

## Purging An Index

To delete the index database for a spec:

```bash
acuity-index purge-index ./mychain.toml
```
